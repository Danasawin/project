        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><h3>Prepare Filling</h3>
                In a large bowl, combine ground pork, shredded cabbage, green onions, garlic, ginger, soy sauce, sesame oil, sugar, salt, and black pepper. Mix until well combined.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Fill Gyoza Wrappers</h3>
                Place a spoonful of filling in the center of each gyoza wrapper. Moisten the edges of the wrapper with water, then fold the wrapper in half and pinch the edges to seal, creating pleats along one side.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Cook Gyoza</h3>
                Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Arrange the gyoza in the skillet in a single layer, pleated side up. Cook until the bottoms are golden brown, about 2-3 minutes.
                <br>Pour water into the skillet, cover, and steam the gyoza for 5-6 minutes, or until the water has evaporated and the filling is cooked through.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Serve</h3>
                Remove the gyoza from the skillet and serve hot with dipping sauce made with soy sauce, rice vinegar, and chili oil. Enjoy the delicious homemade Gyoza!
