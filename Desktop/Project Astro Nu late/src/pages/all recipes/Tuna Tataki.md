        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><h3>Prepare Tuna</h3>
                Pat dry sushi-grade tuna steak with paper towels. Season with salt and pepper.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Sear Tuna</h3>
                Heat sesame oil in a skillet or frying pan over high heat. Sear the tuna steak for 1-2 minutes on each side until lightly browned on the outside but still rare in the center.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Marinate</h3>
                In a bowl, mix soy sauce, minced garlic, grated ginger, and thinly sliced green onions. Add sesame seeds and optional chili flakes or yuzu kosho for extra flavor.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Slice</h3>
                Remove the seared tuna from the skillet and let it rest for a few minutes. Slice the tuna thinly against the grain.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Serve</h3>
                Arrange the sliced tuna on a serving platter. Drizzle with ponzu sauce and serve with wasabi paste on the side. Enjoy tuna tataki as an appetizer or light main course!
