    <div class="instructions">
        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><h3>Preheat Oven</h3>
                Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).
            </li>
            <li><h3>Prepare Duck</h3>
                Rinse the duck inside and out under cold water. Pat dry with paper towels. Season the duck inside and out with salt and black pepper.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Make Orange Glaze</h3>
                In a saucepan, combine orange juice, honey, red wine vinegar, soy sauce, minced garlic, and ground ginger. Zest one orange and add the zest to the saucepan. Juice one orange and add the juice to the saucepan. Bring the mixture to a simmer over medium heat and cook for 5-7 minutes until slightly thickened.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Cook Duck</h3>
                Place the seasoned duck on a rack in a roasting pan. Pierce the skin of the duck all over with a sharp knife or fork to help render the fat. Brush the duck with the orange glaze, reserving some glaze for basting.
                <br>Roast the duck in the preheated oven for about 2 hours, basting with the orange glaze every 30 minutes, until the skin is crispy and golden brown and the internal temperature reaches 165°F (75°C).
            </li>
            <li><h3>Serve</h3>
                Once cooked, remove the duck from the oven and let it rest for 10-15 minutes before carving. Garnish with chopped fresh parsley if desired.
                <br>Serve Duck à l'Orange with roasted vegetables, rice, or salad, and enjoy!
