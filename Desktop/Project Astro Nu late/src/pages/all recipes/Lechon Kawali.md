        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><h3>Boil Pork Belly</h3>
                In a large pot, combine pork belly, water, bay leaf, smashed garlic, salt, and black peppercorns. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to low and simmer for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until pork is tender.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Dry and Chill</h3>
                Remove pork belly from the pot and pat dry with paper towels. Place the pork belly on a wire rack and let it air dry in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours or overnight. This will help the skin become crispy when fried.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Fry Pork Belly</h3>
                Heat vegetable oil in a deep fryer or large pot to 350°F (175°C). Carefully lower the pork belly into the hot oil and fry for 8-10 minutes, or until the skin is golden and crispy. Remove from oil and drain on paper towels.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Rest and Serve</h3>
                Let the Lechon Kawali rest for a few minutes before slicing into bite-sized pieces. Serve hot with steamed rice and Mang Tomas (sweet liver sauce) for dipping. Enjoy the crispy and succulent Lechon Kawali!
