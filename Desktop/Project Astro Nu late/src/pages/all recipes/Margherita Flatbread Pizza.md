        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><h3>Preheat Oven</h3>
                Preheat your oven to the highest temperature setting (usually around 500°F or 260°C). Place a pizza stone or upside-down baking sheet in the oven to preheat as well.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Prepare Dough</h3>
                On a lightly floured surface, roll out the pizza dough into a circle or rectangle, depending on your preference. Transfer the dough to a piece of parchment paper dusted with cornmeal.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Assemble Pizza</h3>
                Spread pizza sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges. Arrange sliced mozzarella cheese and tomato slices on top of the sauce. Season with salt and black pepper. Drizzle with olive oil.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Bake</h3>
                Carefully transfer the parchment paper with the assembled pizza onto the preheated pizza stone or baking sheet in the oven. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly and melted.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Finish and Serve</h3>
                Remove the pizza from the oven and immediately sprinkle with fresh basil leaves. Let it cool for a minute before slicing. Serve hot and enjoy the classic flavors of Margherita Pizza!
