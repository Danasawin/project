        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><h3>Marinate the Beef</h3>
                In a bowl, combine the thinly sliced beef with soy sauce, sesame oil, brown sugar, minced garlic, salt, and pepper. Mix well to ensure the beef is evenly coated with the marinade. Cover the bowl and let the beef marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes, or up to overnight for best flavor.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Cook the Vegetables</h3>
                Prepare the assorted vegetables by washing and cutting them into bite-sized pieces. Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the vegetables to the skillet and stir-fry them until they are tender-crisp. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Remove the cooked vegetables from the skillet and set them aside.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Cook the Bulgogi</h3>
                In the same skillet, add the marinated beef and cook it over medium-high heat until it is browned and cooked through, about 3-4 minutes per side. Remove the cooked beef from the skillet and set it aside.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Cook the Eggs</h3>
                In the same skillet, crack the eggs and cook them to your desired doneness (fried, sunny-side-up, or scrambled).
            </li>
            <li><h3>Assemble the Bibimbap</h3>
                To assemble the bibimbap, divide the cooked rice among serving bowls. Arrange the cooked vegetables, bulgogi, and cooked eggs on top of the rice in separate sections. Garnish with sesame seeds and sliced green onions.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Serve</h3>
                Serve the bibimbap immediately, with kimchi and gochujang on the side if desired. Mix everything together before eating to enjoy all the flavors combined!
