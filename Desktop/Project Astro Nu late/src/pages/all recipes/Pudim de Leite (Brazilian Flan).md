        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 can (14 oz) sweetened condensed milk</li>
            <li>1 can (12 oz) evaporated milk</li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 cup sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup water</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><h3>Preheat Oven</h3>
                Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C).
            </li>
            <li><h3>Make Caramel</h3>
                In a small saucepan, combine sugar and water. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until sugar dissolves and turns golden brown. Pour caramel into the bottom of a flan mold or baking dish, tilting to coat the bottom evenly.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Blend Ingredients</h3>
                In a blender, combine sweetened condensed milk, evaporated milk, eggs, and vanilla extract. Blend until smooth and well combined.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Pour Mixture</h3>
                Pour the milk mixture over the caramel in the flan mold or baking dish.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Bake</h3>
                Place the flan mold or baking dish in a larger baking pan. Fill the larger pan with hot water halfway up the sides of the flan mold or baking dish. Bake for about 50-60 minutes, or until the flan is set but still jiggly in the center.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Chill</h3>
                Remove from oven and let the flan cool to room temperature. Then refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or overnight, until completely chilled and set.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Unmold</h3>
                To serve, run a knife around the edges of the flan to loosen it. Invert onto a serving plate, allowing the caramel to drizzle over the top. Slice and serve chilled. Enjoy this creamy and decadent Brazilian dessert!
