        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><h3>Prepare Veal Shanks</h3>
                Season veal shanks with salt and black pepper, then dredge in flour, shaking off any excess.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Brown Veal Shanks</h3>
                In a large skillet or Dutch oven, heat olive oil over medium-high heat. Brown veal shanks on all sides, about 5 minutes per side. Remove from skillet and set aside.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Sauté Vegetables</h3>
                In the same skillet, add chopped onion, carrots, celery, and garlic. Sauté until vegetables are softened, about 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Deglaze</h3>
                Pour in white wine and simmer until reduced by half, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the skillet.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Add Remaining Ingredients</h3>
                Return veal shanks to the skillet. Add beef or veal broth, diced tomatoes, bay leaf, and lemon zest. Bring to a simmer.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Braise</h3>
                Cover and simmer over low heat for about 2 hours, or until veal is tender and falling off the bone.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Serve</h3>
                Serve Ossobuco alla Milanese hot over cooked risotto or mashed potatoes. Garnish with chopped parsley and grated Parmesan cheese. Enjoy this classic Italian dish!
