        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><h3>Prepare Ingredients</h3>
                Prepare sushi rice and slice fillings into thin strips.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Assemble Sushi Rolls</h3>
                Place a sheet of nori seaweed on a bamboo sushi rolling mat, shiny side down. Spread a thin layer of sushi rice over the nori, leaving a small border along the edges.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Add Fillings</h3>
                Arrange fillings horizontally across the center of the rice-covered nori sheet.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Roll Sushi</h3>
                Roll the sushi tightly using the bamboo mat, starting from the edge closest to you. Apply gentle pressure while rolling to ensure the sushi holds its shape.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Seal and Slice</h3>
                Once rolled, use a sharp knife to slice the sushi roll into bite-sized pieces. Wipe the knife with a damp cloth between cuts to keep it clean.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Serve</h3>
                Serve sushi rolls with soy sauce, wasabi, and pickled ginger. Sprinkle with sesame seeds if desired. Enjoy making and eating these delicious Japanese sushi rolls!
