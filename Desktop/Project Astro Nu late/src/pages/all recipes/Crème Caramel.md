            <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup water</li>
            <li>4 large eggs</li>
            <li>2 cups whole milk</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>

        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><h3>Preheat Oven</h3>
                Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Place 6 ramekins in a baking dish and set aside.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Make Caramel</h3>
                In a saucepan, combine granulated sugar and water. Cook over medium heat without stirring until the sugar dissolves and the mixture turns amber in color.
                <br>Quickly pour the caramel into the bottom of each ramekin, tilting and swirling to coat the bottom evenly. Be careful as the caramel will be very hot.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Make Custard</h3>
                In a mixing bowl, whisk together eggs, milk, vanilla extract, and salt until well combined.
                <br>Pour the custard mixture into the caramel-coated ramekins.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Bake</h3>
                Fill the baking dish with hot water until it reaches halfway up the sides of the ramekins.
                <br>Bake in the preheated oven for 40-45 minutes, or until the custard is set but still jiggles slightly in the center.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Chill</h3>
                Remove the ramekins from the water bath and let them cool to room temperature. Then, cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or until thoroughly chilled.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Unmold and Serve</h3>
                To serve, run a knife around the edge of each ramekin to loosen the custard. Place a serving plate on top of each ramekin and carefully invert to release the crème caramel onto the plate.
                <br>Serve chilled and enjoy the silky smooth texture of Crème Caramel!
