            <li><h3>Mix Ingredients</h3>
                In a large bowl, combine all-purpose flour, instant yeast, and salt. Gradually add water while mixing until a dough forms.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Knead</h3>
                Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead for about 10 minutes, or until the dough is smooth and elastic.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Rise</h3>
                Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour, or until doubled in size.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Shape</h3>
                Punch down the risen dough and divide it into equal portions. Shape each portion into a round ball and place them on a greased baking sheet, leaving space between each roll.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Second Rise</h3>
                Cover the shaped rolls with a damp cloth and let them rise for another 30-45 minutes, or until doubled in size.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Bake</h3>
                Preheat oven to 200°C (400°F). Bake the rolls for 15-20 minutes, or until golden brown and cooked through.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Cool</h3>
                Remove the rolls from the oven and let them cool on a wire rack before serving. Enjoy Pão de Açúcar warm or at room temperature!
