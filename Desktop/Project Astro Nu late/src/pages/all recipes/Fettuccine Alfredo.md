            <li><h3>Cook Pasta</h3>
                Cook the fettuccine pasta in a large pot of salted boiling water according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain the pasta, reserving some pasta water, and set aside.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Make Alfredo Sauce</h3>
                In a saucepan, melt unsalted butter over medium heat. Add minced garlic and saut√© until fragrant.
                <br>Pour in heavy cream and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to low and stir in grated Parmesan cheese until melted and smooth. Season with salt and black pepper to taste.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Combine Pasta and Sauce</h3>
                Add the cooked fettuccine pasta to the Alfredo sauce, tossing gently to coat the pasta evenly. If the sauce is too thick, you can add some reserved pasta water to thin it out.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Serve</h3>
                Transfer the Fettuccine Alfredo to serving plates or bowls. Garnish with chopped fresh parsley if desired. Serve hot and enjoy the creamy, cheesy goodness!
