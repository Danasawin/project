        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><h3>Marinate the Chicken</h3>
                In a large bowl, combine yogurt, lemon juice, and salt. Add the chicken pieces and toss until they are evenly coated. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or preferably overnight.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Cook the Chicken</h3>
                Heat butter in a large skillet or pot over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook until soft and translucent, about 5-7 minutes. Add the minced garlic and grated ginger, and cook for another 2 minutes, stirring frequently.
                <br>
                Add the marinated chicken pieces to the skillet, along with any excess marinade. Cook until the chicken is browned on all sides, about 5-7 minutes.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Add Spices and Sauce</h3>
                Sprinkle ground cumin, ground coriander, garam masala, turmeric, and cayenne pepper over the chicken. Stir well to coat the chicken with the spices. Pour in the tomato sauce and heavy cream, and stir to combine.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Simmer</h3>
                Reduce the heat to low and let the mixture simmer for 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the chicken is cooked through and the sauce has thickened.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Serve</h3>
                Season with salt and pepper to taste. Garnish with fresh cilantro before serving. Serve hot with rice or naan bread.
            </li>
