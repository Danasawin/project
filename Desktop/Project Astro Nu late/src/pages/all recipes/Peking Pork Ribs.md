            <li><h3>Marinate Ribs</h3>
                In a bowl, mix together soy sauce, hoisin sauce, honey, rice vinegar, minced garlic, Chinese five-spice powder, white pepper, and water to make the marinade. Add pork ribs to the marinade and toss until evenly coated. Let the ribs marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours, or overnight for best results.
