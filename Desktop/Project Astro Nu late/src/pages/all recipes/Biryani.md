        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><h3>Prepare the Marinade</h3>
                In a large bowl, combine the plain yogurt, chopped tomatoes, chopped cilantro, chopped mint leaves, minced garlic, grated ginger, chopped green chilies, ground turmeric, ground cumin, ground coriander, ground cinnamon, ground cloves, ground cardamom, ground nutmeg, salt, and pepper. Mix well to combine.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Marinate the Chicken (or Vegetables)</h3>
                Add the chicken pieces (or vegetables/tofu) to the marinade and toss until they are evenly coated. Cover the bowl and let the mixture marinate in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour, or preferably overnight for best flavor.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Prepare the Rice</h3>
                Rinse the basmati rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Soak the rice in water for about 30 minutes, then drain.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Cook the Biryani</h3>
                In a large skillet or pot, heat the ghee or vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the thinly sliced onion and cook until it is caramelized and golden brown. Remove half of the caramelized onions from the skillet and set them aside for garnish.
                Add the marinated chicken (or vegetables/tofu) to the skillet with the remaining onions and cook until it is browned on all sides. Add the soaked and drained rice to the skillet and stir to combine with the chicken and onions.
                Pour in the water and bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover the skillet, and let the biryani simmer for about 20-25 minutes, or until the rice is cooked through and the liquid is absorbed.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Serve</h3>
                Remove the skillet from the heat and let the biryani rest for a few minutes. Fluff the rice with a fork and garnish with the reserved caramelized onions, fried onions, sliced almonds or cashews, and raisins if desired. Serve hot with fresh lemon wedges on the side.
