        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul> <br>
            2 lbs chicken wings <br> <br>
            1/2 cup soy sauce  <br> <br>
            1/2 cup vinegar (white or apple cider vinegar) <br> <br>
            1/4 cup water <br> <br>
             4 cloves garlic, minced <br> <br>
             1 bay leaf <br> <br>
             1 teaspoon whole black peppercorns <br> <br>
             2 tablespoons brown sugar (optional) <br> <br>
             Cooking oil <br> <br>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><h3>Prepare the Chicken Wings</h3>
                Rinse the chicken wings under cold water and pat them dry with paper towels. If desired, you can cut the wings into two pieces at the joints to separate the drumettes from the wingettes.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Marinate the Chicken</h3>
                In a large bowl, combine soy sauce, vinegar, water, minced garlic, bay leaf, black peppercorns, and brown sugar (if using). Stir well to combine. Add the chicken wings to the marinade and toss until they are evenly coated. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or transfer the mixture to a resealable plastic bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour, or preferably overnight for best flavor.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Cook the Chicken</h3>
                Heat a large skillet or frying pan over medium-high heat. Add a little cooking oil to the pan. Once the oil is hot, add the marinated chicken wings to the pan in a single layer, reserving the marinade for later use. Cook the chicken wings for about 5-6 minutes on each side, or until they are golden brown and crispy.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Simmer in Adobo Sauce</h3>
                Once the chicken wings are browned, pour the reserved marinade into the pan. Bring the liquid to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and let the chicken wings simmer in the adobo sauce for about 20-25 minutes, or until the wings are fully cooked and the sauce has thickened slightly.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Serve</h3>
                Once the chicken wings are cooked through and the sauce has thickened, remove the pan from the heat. Transfer the Chicken Adobo Wings to a serving plate and drizzle some of the thickened sauce over the top. Garnish with chopped green onions or cilantro if desired, and serve hot.
