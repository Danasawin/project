            <li><h3>Cook the Potatoes</h3>
                Place the quartered red potatoes in a pot of salted water. Bring to a boil and cook until the potatoes are fork-tender, about 10-12 minutes. Drain and set aside to cool.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Cook the Bratwurst</h3>
                Grill or cook the bratwurst sausages according to your preference until they are cooked through and have nice grill marks. Let them cool slightly, then slice them into bite-sized pieces.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Make the Dressing</h3>
                In a small bowl, whisk together mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, apple cider vinegar, chopped fresh dill, and sliced green onions. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Assemble the Potato Salad</h3>
                In a large mixing bowl, combine the cooked and cooled potatoes, sliced bratwurst sausages, and the prepared dressing. Gently toss until everything is evenly coated. Serve chilled or at room temperature.
