        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><h3>Prepare Batter</h3>
                In a large bowl, mix rice flour, urad dal flour, and fenugreek seeds. Gradually add water and whisk until you get a smooth batter with a pouring consistency. Add salt to taste and mix well. Let the batter ferment overnight or for at least 6-8 hours.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Cook Dosa</h3>
                Heat a non-stick skillet or dosa pan over medium heat. Grease the pan lightly with oil. Pour a ladleful of batter onto the center of the pan and spread it outwards in a circular motion to form a thin, even layer.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Crisp Up</h3>
                Drizzle a little oil around the edges of the dosa. Cook until the edges start to lift and turn golden brown, and the bottom is crispy. Flip the dosa and cook for another minute on the other side.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Serve</h3>
                Transfer the dosa to a serving plate. Serve hot with coconut chutney, sambar, and optionally some butter. Enjoy the crispy and flavorful Masala Dosa as a delightful breakfast or snack!
