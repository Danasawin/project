        <ol>
            <li><h3>Prepare Duck</h3>
                Clean the duck thoroughly and pat dry with paper towels. Remove excess fat and trim any loose skin.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Marinate</h3>
                In a small bowl, mix together honey, soy sauce, rice vinegar, hoisin sauce, Chinese five-spice powder, salt, and water to make the marinade. Brush the marinade over the duck, making sure to coat it evenly. Let the duck marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours, or overnight for best results.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Cook</h3>
                Preheat oven to 375째F (190째C). Place the marinated duck on a rack in a roasting pan, breast-side up. Roast for about 1.5 to 2 hours, or until the skin is crispy and golden brown, and the internal temperature reaches 165째F (74째C).
            </li>
            <li><h3>Rest</h3>
                Remove the duck from the oven and let it rest for 10-15 minutes before carving.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Serve</h3>
                Carve the Peking duck and serve with warm pancakes, sliced spring onions, cucumber, and hoisin sauce. Enjoy this classic Chinese dish!
