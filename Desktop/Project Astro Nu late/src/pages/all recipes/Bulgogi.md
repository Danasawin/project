            <li><h3>Marinate the Beef</h3>
                In a bowl, whisk together soy sauce, brown sugar, sesame oil, minced garlic, grated ginger, sliced green onions, and sesame seeds. Add the thinly sliced beef to the marinade and toss to coat. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or preferably overnight.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Cook the Bulgogi</h3>
                Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet or grill pan over medium-high heat. Add the marinated beef in a single layer and cook for about 2-3 minutes per side, or until browned and cooked through. Cook in batches if needed.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Serve</h3>
                Serve the cooked bulgogi hot with steamed rice and your choice of vegetables. Garnish with additional sliced green onions and sesame seeds, if desired.
