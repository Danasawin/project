            <li><h3>Prepare Chicken Filling</h3>
                In a saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Add chopped onions and minced garlic, and sauté until softened.

            <li><h3>Make Dough</h3>

            <li><h3>Shape Coxinha</h3>
                Take a portion of the dough and flatten it in your hand. Place a spoonful of the chicken filling in the center and shape it into a teardrop or drumstick shape.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Bread and Fry</h3>
                Roll each coxinha in breadcrumbs until coated evenly. Heat vegetable oil in a deep fryer or pot to 350°F (175°C). Fry the coxinhas until golden brown and crispy.
