        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3/4 cup warm water</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons plain yogurt</li>

        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><h3>Prepare the Dough</h3>
                In a small bowl, combine warm water, sugar, and yeast. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes until frothy.
                <br>
                In a large mixing bowl, combine flour and salt. Make a well in the center and add the activated yeast mixture, yogurt, and melted butter. Mix until it forms a dough.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Knead the Dough</h3>
                Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead for 5-7 minutes until smooth and elastic. Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for 1-2 hours, or until doubled in size.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Shape and Cook the Naan</h3>
                Divide the dough into equal-sized balls. Roll each ball into a circle or oval shape, about 1/4 inch thick. Heat a skillet or tawa over medium-high heat. Place the rolled naan onto the hot skillet and cook for 1-2 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and puffed up.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Butter the Naan</h3>
                Brush the cooked naan with melted butter while it's still hot. Serve immediately or keep warm in a towel-lined basket until ready to serve.
