        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><h3>Prepare the Seafood</h3>
                Clean and prepare the fish and shellfish as needed. Remove any scales, shells, and innards. Cut the larger fish into smaller pieces if necessary. Rinse the seafood under cold water and pat it dry with paper towels. Season with salt and pepper.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Sauté the Aromatics</h3>
                Heat a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add a drizzle of olive oil to the pot. Add the chopped onion, celery, carrots, garlic, and sliced fennel. Sauté the vegetables until they are softened and fragrant, about 5-7 minutes.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Add the Tomatoes and Tomato Paste</h3>
                Add the chopped tomatoes and tomato paste to the pot. Stir to combine and cook for another 2-3 minutes.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Deglaze with Wine</h3>
                Pour in the dry white wine and stir to scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot. Let the wine simmer for a few minutes to reduce slightly.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Add the Stock and Seasonings</h3>
                Pour in the fish or seafood stock, then add the chopped parsley, fresh thyme leaves, bay leaf, and saffron threads if using. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Bring the mixture to a simmer.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Cook the Bouillabaisse</h3>
                Once the broth is simmering, add the prepared fish and shellfish to the pot. Cover and let the bouillabaisse cook for about 10-15 minutes, or until the seafood is cooked through and tender.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Serve</h3>
                Remove the pot from the heat and discard the bay leaf. Ladle the bouillabaisse into serving bowls and serve hot with crusty bread and rouille on the side.
