            <li><h3>Prepare Puff Pastry</h3>
                Preheat your oven according to the puff pastry package instructions. Thaw the puff pastry dough if frozen, and roll it out into a large rectangle.

            <li><h3>Fill and Shape Croissants</h3>
                Cut the puff pastry into triangles. Place a small handful of chocolate chips at the base of each triangle. Roll the dough up, starting from the base to the tip, to form croissants.
