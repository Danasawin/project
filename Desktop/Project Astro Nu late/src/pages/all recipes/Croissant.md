        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><h3>Activate Yeast</h3>
                In a bowl, combine warm milk, yeast, and sugar. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until foamy.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Mix Dough</h3>
                In a large bowl, mix together flour and salt. Cut cold butter into small pieces and mix into the flour mixture until crumbly.
                <br>Add the yeast mixture to the flour mixture and knead until a smooth dough forms.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Chill and Fold</h3>
                Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour, or overnight.
                <br>Roll out the chilled dough into a rectangle. Fold the dough into thirds, like a letter, then roll it out again. Repeat this process twice more.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Shape Croissants</h3>
                Cut the dough into triangles. Roll each triangle from the base to the tip to form croissants.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Bake</h3>
                Place the croissants on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Brush the tops with beaten egg for a golden finish.
                <br>Let the croissants rise for 1-2 hours until puffy. Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C) and bake for 15-20 minutes, or until golden brown.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Cool and Serve</h3>
                Remove from the oven and let the croissants cool on a wire rack. Serve warm and enjoy!
