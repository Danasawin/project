        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><h3>Cook the Bratwurst</h3>
                Preheat grill or grill pan to medium-high heat. Grill the bratwurst sausages for about 5-7 minutes per side, or until they are cooked through and have nice grill marks. Remove from the grill and set aside.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Sauté the Onions and Peppers</h3>
                In a skillet, heat olive oil and butter over medium heat. Add the thinly sliced onions and peppers to the skillet. Sauté until they are softened and caramelized, about 10-12 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Assemble the Platter</h3>
                Slice the pretzel rolls or buns in half lengthwise. Place a grilled bratwurst sausage in each roll. Top with the sautéed onions and peppers. Serve with mustard and sauerkraut on the side.
