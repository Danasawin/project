        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><h3>Prepare the Dough</h3>
                In a mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, active dry yeast, and sugar. Slowly add the warm water while mixing until a dough forms. Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 5-10 minutes, or until it becomes smooth and elastic. Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it with a clean towel, and let it rest for about 1 hour, or until it doubles in size.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Prepare the Filling</h3>
                In a separate bowl, mix together the ground pork, soy sauce, oyster sauce, sesame oil, minced garlic, chopped green onions, salt, and black pepper until well combined.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Shape the Baozi</h3>
                Punch down the risen dough and divide it into equal-sized pieces. Roll each piece into a ball and flatten it into a circle with your hands or a rolling pin. Place a spoonful of the pork filling in the center of each dough circle. Fold the edges of the dough up and over the filling, pinching them together at the top to seal.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Steam the Baozi</h3>
                Place the assembled baozi on squares of parchment paper and arrange them in a steamer basket, leaving space between each one. Cover the steamer basket with a lid and steam the baozi over boiling water for about 15-20 minutes, or until the dough is cooked through and the filling is hot and cooked.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Serve</h3>
                Remove the steamed baozi from the steamer and serve them hot. Enjoy your delicious homemade baozi!
