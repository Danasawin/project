        <ol>
            <li><h3>Pound and Season</h3>
                If using pork chops or chicken breasts, place them between two sheets of plastic wrap and pound them to an even thickness. Season both sides of the meat with salt and pepper.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Bread the Meat</h3>
                Set up three shallow bowls. In the first bowl, place all-purpose flour. In the second bowl, beat eggs. In the third bowl, combine breadcrumbs, paprika, garlic powder, salt, and pepper.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Coat and Fry</h3>
                Dredge each piece of meat in the flour, shaking off any excess. Dip in beaten eggs, then coat with breadcrumb mixture, pressing gently to adhere. Repeat with remaining pieces.
                Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Fry schnitzel in hot oil for 3-4 minutes per side, or until golden brown and cooked through. Drain on paper towels.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Serve</h3>
                Serve schnitzel hot with lemon wedges for squeezing over the top. Enjoy this crispy and flavorful German dish with your favorite side dishes!
