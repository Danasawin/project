        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><h3>Bread Chicken</h3>
                In a bowl, coat the chicken pieces evenly with cornstarch.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Fry Chicken</h3>
                Heat vegetable oil in a skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Fry the breaded chicken pieces in batches until golden brown and cooked through. Remove from the oil and drain on paper towels.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Make Sauce</h3>
                In the same skillet or wok, saut√© minced garlic and chopped green onions until fragrant. Add soy sauce, hoisin sauce, rice vinegar, and sugar. Stir to combine.
                <br>Gradually add the cornstarch mixture, stirring constantly until the sauce thickens.

            <li><h3>Combine and Serve</h3>
                Return the fried chicken to the skillet or wok, tossing to coat evenly with the sauce. Cook for another minute until the chicken is heated through and the sauce clings to the chicken.
