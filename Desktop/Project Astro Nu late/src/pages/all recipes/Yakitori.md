            <li><h3>Prepare Marinade</h3>
                In a bowl, mix soy sauce, mirin, sake, and sugar to make the yakitori marinade. Adjust the proportions to your taste.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Marinate Chicken</h3>
                Marinate chicken pieces in the prepared marinade for at least 30 minutes, or preferably overnight for maximum flavor.

                Sprinkle grilled yakitori skewers with shichimi togarashi for extra heat and flavor, if desired.
