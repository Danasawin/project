            <li><h3>Marinate Paneer</h3>
                In a bowl, mix together yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric powder, garam masala, lemon juice, vegetable oil, and salt to taste. Add cubed paneer, diced bell pepper, and diced onion. Mix well to coat the paneer and vegetables with the marinade. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Assemble Skewers</h3>
                Thread marinated paneer, bell pepper, and onion onto soaked wooden skewers, alternating between the ingredients.

            <li><h3>Grill</h3>
                Preheat grill or grill pan over medium-high heat. Brush with oil to prevent sticking. Grill paneer skewers for 5-7 minutes on each side, or until paneer is golden brown and vegetables are tender.
