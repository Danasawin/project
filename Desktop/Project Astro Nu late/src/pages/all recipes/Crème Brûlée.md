        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 large egg yolks</li>
            <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons granulated sugar (for caramelizing)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="instructions">
        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><h3>Preheat Oven</h3>
                Preheat your oven to 300°F (150°C). Place 4 ramekins in a baking dish and set aside.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Make Custard</h3>
                In a bowl, whisk together egg yolks, sugar, and vanilla extract until well combined.
                <br>In a saucepan, heat heavy cream over medium heat until it just begins to simmer. Slowly pour the hot cream into the egg yolk mixture while whisking continuously.
                <br>Strain the custard mixture through a fine mesh sieve to remove any lumps.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Bake</h3>
                Pour the custard mixture into the prepared ramekins. Carefully pour hot water into the baking dish to create a water bath, filling it about halfway up the sides of the ramekins.
                <br>Bake in the preheated oven for 35-40 minutes, or until the custard is set but still slightly jiggly in the center.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Chill</h3>
                Remove the ramekins from the water bath and let them cool to room temperature. Then, cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or until thoroughly chilled.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Caramelize Sugar</h3>
                Just before serving, sprinkle a thin, even layer of granulated sugar over the surface of each custard. Use a kitchen torch to caramelize the sugar until it forms a golden-brown crust.
                <br>Alternatively, place the ramekins under a broiler for 1-2 minutes until the sugar caramelizes.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Serve</h3>
                Allow the caramelized sugar to harden for a minute or two, then serve immediately and enjoy the creamy, crunchy delight of Crème Brûlée!
