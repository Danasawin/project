        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><h3>Prepare Meat Sauce</h3>
                In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add chopped onion and minced garlic, sauté until softened. Add ground beef and cook until browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper. Simmer for 15-20 minutes.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Assemble Lasagna</h3>
                Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). Spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange a layer of cooked lasagna noodles over the sauce. Spread a layer of ricotta cheese over the noodles. Sprinkle with shredded mozzarella and grated Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers until all ingredients are used, ending with a layer of cheese on top.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Bake</h3>
                Cover the baking dish with foil and bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Remove foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly and the edges are golden brown.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Rest and Serve</h3>
                Let the lasagna rest for 10-15 minutes before slicing. Garnish with fresh basil leaves if desired. Serve hot and enjoy the comforting and cheesy Lasagna!
