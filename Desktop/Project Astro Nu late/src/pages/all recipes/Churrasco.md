        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 lbs beef steak (such as sirloin, ribeye, or flank steak)</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons red wine vinegar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
            <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><h3>Marinate the Steak</h3>
                In a bowl, whisk together minced garlic, olive oil, chopped parsley, red wine vinegar, paprika, salt, and black pepper.
                <br>Place the beef steak in a shallow dish or a resealable plastic bag. Pour the marinade over the steak, making sure it's evenly coated. Cover the dish or seal the bag, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or preferably overnight.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Prepare the Grill</h3>
                Preheat your grill to high heat. Clean and oil the grill grates to prevent sticking.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Grill the Steak</h3>
                Remove the steak from the marinade and let any excess drip off. Discard the remaining marinade.
                <br>Place the steak on the hot grill and cook for about 4-5 minutes per side for medium-rare, or adjust cooking time according to your desired level of doneness.
            </li>
            <li><h3>Rest and Serve</h3>
                Once cooked to your liking, transfer the steak to a cutting board and let it rest for a few minutes to allow the juices to redistribute. Slice the steak against the grain into thin strips.
                <br>Serve hot with chimichurri sauce, grilled vegetables, and your favorite side dishes.
            </li>
